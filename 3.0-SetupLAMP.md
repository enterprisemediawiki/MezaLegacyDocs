# Configuring CentOS
This manual explains how to setup LAMP: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP. Linux is already setup from previous manuals, so really this is just the AMP part.  

## Install Perl
Perl is required for building certain other packages from source. Most Linux distributions have it built in, but the CentOS minimum install does not. Install Perl:

```
yum install perl
```

## Install Apache

Install Apache using [these steps](3.1-InstallApache.md).

### Testing Apache

Create an index.html file at your webserver root:

```
cd /var/www/meza/htdocs
echo "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>" > index.html
```

Navigate to http://192.168.56.56 from your host machine. If you're successful then Apache is working and your VM is serving over HTTP. Congratulations. **Create a snapshot**.


## Install PHP

See [Install PHP](3.2-InstallPHP.md). When complete, **create a snapshot**.


## Install MySQL

Install MySQL using [these instructions](3.3-InstallMySQL.md).


## Install other stuff

```
yum -y install git
```
