# Install PHP

## Not yum
Running "yum install php" installs PHP 5.3 on CentOS 6. We want 5.5 at a minimum. Note that if you do install with yum, then regret your decision, to remove PHP with yum you may have to do the following:

```
yum remove php
yum remove php-cli
yum remove php-common
```

## Installing PHP 5.6 from source

In developing the following procedure the following tutorials were used: [1](http://benramsey.com/blog/2012/03/build-php-54-on-centos-62/) and [2](http://blog.astaz3l.com/2015/02/25/php-install-from-source/)

### Installing libmcrypt-devel

Many dependencies need to be installed. Most of them can be installed with straight yum, but libmcrypt-devel cannot. There is no yum package "libmcrypt-devel" (or libmcrypt, for that matter). To install it, you must do some manual setup first. See http://benramsey.com/blog/2012/03/build-php-54-on-centos-62/ for more info.

Change to user home directory:
```
cd ~
```

If you're on a 32-bit system
```
wget http://pkgs.repoforge.org/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.3-1.el6.rf.i686.rpm
```

If you're on a 64-bit system
```
wget http://pkgs.repoforge.org/rpmforge-release/rpmforge-release-0.5.3-1.el6.rf.x86_64.rpm
```

Then run these:
```
rpm --import http://apt.sw.be/RPM-GPG-KEY.dag.txt
rpm -K rpmforge-release-0.5.3-1.el6.rf.*.rpm # Verifies the package
rpm -i rpmforge-release-0.5.3-1.el6.rf.*.rpm
yum install libmcrypt-devel
```

### Installing other dependencies

To install other PHP requirements, perform the following. First should determine what all of them do and figure out if they're needed. Also check to see if they actually install via yum...would totally have missed libmcrypt-devel.

```
yum install \
    curl-devel \
    libc-client-devel.i686 \
    libc-client-devel \
    libxml2-devel \
    libXpm-devel \
    gmp-devel \
    libicu-devel \
    t1lib-devel \
    aspell-devel \
    openssl-devel \
    bzip2-devel \
    libcurl-devel \
    libjpeg-devel \
    libvpx-devel \
    libpng-devel \
    freetype-devel \
    readline-devel \
    libtidy-devel \
```

### Building PHP from source

Download PHP 5.6.10 and unpack it.

Note: Need to check into MediaWiki's and SMW's requirements and figure out what makes sense to download.

```
cd ~/mezadownloads
wget http://php.net/get/php-5.6.10.tar.bz2/from/this/mirror -O php-5.6.10.tar.bz2
tar jxf php-5.6.10.tar.bz2
cd php-5.6.10/
```

Configure and make PHP. Need to determine if this configuration is right, but it's a start. @todo: figure out what we need.

Note: this takes a while, particularly the "make" step.

```
./configure \
    --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs \
	--enable-bcmath \
	--with-bz2 \
	--enable-calendar \
	--with-curl \
	--enable-exif \
	--enable-ftp \
	--with-gd \
	--with-jpeg-dir \
	--with-png-dir \
	--with-freetype-dir \
	--enable-gd-native-ttf \
	--with-imap \
	--with-imap-ssl \
	--with-kerberos \
	--enable-mbstring \
	--with-mcrypt \
	--with-mhash \
	--with-mysql \
	--with-mysqli \
	--with-openssl \
	--with-pcre-regex \
	--with-pdo-mysql \
	--with-zlib-dir \
	--with-regex \
	--enable-sysvsem \
	--enable-sysvshm \
	--enable-sysvmsg \
	--enable-soap \
	--enable-sockets \
	--with-xmlrpc \
	--enable-zip \
	--with-zlib \
	--enable-inline-optimization \
	--enable-mbregex \
	--enable-opcache \
	--enable-fpm \
	--prefix=/usr/local/php
make
make install
```

## Add PHP to path

Create a new profile file to add php to path

```
echo "export PATH=/usr/local/php/bin:\$PATH" > /etc/profile.d/php.sh
```

## Setup Apache to serve PHP

Copy files from PHP source (e.g. ~/mezadownloads/php-5.6.10/php.ini-development) to /usr/local/lib

```
cp php.ini-development /usr/local/php/lib/php.ini
```

Confirm this line exists and is not commented out in /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

```
LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so
```

Add the following below the section with all the "LoadModule" statements:

```
<FilesMatch "\.ph(p[2-6]?|tml)$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
<IfModule !php5_module>
    <FilesMatch "\.ph(p[2-6]?|tml)$">
        Order allow,deny
        Deny from all
    </FilesMatch>
</IfModule>
```

Restart Apache:

```
service httpd restart
```
